./install-cursor.sh "https://downloads.cursor.com/production/client/linux/x64/appimage/Cursor-0.46.11-...AppImage"
```

## âœ… After Installation
- All files are stored in: `~/apps/cursor`
- CLI command: `cursor`
- Menu entry: **Cursor Editor**

## âš  About sandbox mode
Cursor is based on Electron and uses Chromium's sandboxing mechanism. However, in many AppImage builds (including Cursor), full sandboxing may fail even on a regular Ubuntu system due to how the application is packaged.

This installer intentionally runs Cursor with the `--no-sandbox` flag to ensure consistent and stable execution. This is a common practice for Electron-based AppImages and does not affect normal usage for local development.

If the Cursor team improves sandbox compatibility in future builds, you may remove `--no-sandbox` from the launcher script.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements
- Ubuntu (20.04 / 22.04 / 24.04+)
- `wget`, `update-desktop-database`
